# Wallpaper generator

Create a high-quality polygon wallpapers of any size from any image. To run, simply:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

You just need to put a `sample.png` file in the root. You can change a few parameters in the `app.py` file, like wallpaper size and the amount of triangles. Here is an example of the script at work, with the sample first and the result second:

![Sample](examples/blue-purple-sample.png)
![Result](examples/blue-purple-result.png)
